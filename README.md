The request component handles request by a person to an organization, and validation thereof. Examples of requests could be a persons wishing to declare a relocation (verhuizing in dutch) to his new municipality or an intention to marry (melding voorgenomen huwelijk) to his or her municipality.   

Requests signify a request that has either been made by a person/organization to an specific organization, or an request that is being formulated by a person/organization but has not yet been submitted to an organization. As such an requests can be stateless and is by definition without consequence until it is submitted. They represent a form free option for anything that is not an case and a handling route for information that will never become an case.

Technically requests are designed to align with both [DSO]( https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://pre.omgevingswet.overheid.nl/knooppunt/apistore/api-docs/Rijkswaterstaat/Gebruikerstoepassingen-IndienenVerzoek/v1) and the case api [zaak-api]( https://zaken-api.vng.cloud/api/v1/schema), but primely serve to support a [process]( http://ptc.zaakonline.nl). As such, small design interpretation might differ.  They can be found in the [design considerations]( https://github.com/gemeenteshertogenbosch/verzoekregistratiecomponent/blob/master/DESIGN.md).
              
Request cannot be seen as an standalone entity as they take their definition from [request types]( http://vtc.zaakonline.nl/) where the actual rules that a request should adhere to are defined. Requests on them self only serve to store the in between and end results of processes.
