# Requests Registration Component / VRC

Description
----
The request catalog contains both the end and intermediate results of a process. Or to put it more simply, a process writes its variables to a request at each step. This makes the process stateless and the request stateful. In this sense, a request is comparable to a process token in, for example, BPMN engines.

This makes it possible to exchange requests between processes. For example, it is possible to run a process via a chatbot that uses the verhuizen (move house) request type to create a request, but have the request signed via the web form.

From this perspective, a request therefore contains all variables associated with the customer journey linked to a request type. Ultimately, the request type is decisive for the validity and the processes only determine the method of delivery.

This also means that requests can be an unfinished customer journey, or users can put aside their customer journey and continue later. It also means that these customer journeys are in principle transparent to the provider (municipality), in other words if a user gets stuck in a form, he / she can call the helpdesk and a helpdesk employee can watch and supplement. In fact, because changes to requests are logged at the user level and submission is a casual action, it would also be conceivable that an employee or external party would prepare a request for a user to review and sign.

This makes it possible, for example, to have a mover prepare a relocation notification for the user who takes over, signs and sends. Or, for example, a contractor who prepares a building permit for a dormer window.

Incidentally, a request does not have to be based on a process (for example from the Process Catalogue).The only condition of a request is that it fulfills the condition of the corresponding request type at the time of submission.

It is therefore quite conceivable that simple requests are fired in and signed by IOT devices, like a lamppost that reports itself that it is broken.

Installation
----
We differentiate between two way's of installing this component, a local installation as part of the provided developers toolkit or an [helm](https://helm.sh/) installation on an development or production environment. 

#### Local installation
First make sure you have [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) running on your computer. Then clone the repository to a directory on your local machine through a [git command](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone) or [git kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) (ui for git). If successful you can now navigate to the directory of your cloned repository in a command prompt and execute docker-compose up. 
```CLI
$ docker-compose up
```
This will build the docker image and run the used containers and when seeing the log from the php container: "NOTICE: ready to handle connections", u are ready to view the documentation at localhost on your preferred browser.

#### Instalation on Kubernetes or Haven
As a haven compliant commonground component this component is installable on kubernetes trough helm. The helm files can be found in the api/helm folder. For installing this component trough helm simply open your (still) favorite command line interface and run 
```CLI
$ helm install [name] ./api/helm --kubeconfig kubeconfig.yaml --namespace [name] --set settings.env=prod,settings.debug=0,settings.cache=1
```
For an in depth installation guide you can refer to the [installation guide](INSTALLATION.md), it also contains a short tutorial on getting your cluster ready to expose your installation to the world
